# Socks Proxy
A Socks5 server that, when used in conjunction with a [viproxy](https://github.com/blocky/viproxy), grants networking capabilities to a program running in a Nitro Server. The current iteration, however, is coded to only allow connections to [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) for the purpose of getting self-signed certificates. If you wish to communicate with other services, you will have to update the `allowedAddrs` or `allowedFQDNs` variables.
